## You can run a Shiny app by giving the name of its directory to the function runApp(). For example if your Shiny app is in a directory called “Shiny App”, run it with the following code:
## library(shiny)
## runApp("Shiny App")
## Or by just clicking the “Run App” button at the top of the editor which is the safest solution.

#Create an empty app with a blank user-interface.
shinyServer(function(input, output){
  
})
